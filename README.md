# SNCF Api


A class of methods that can call the different SNCF API's from [SNCF Open Data](https://data.sncf.com/), returns data as a [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframe or .json() object.

That Pandas dataframe has some elements clipped.

Some of the calls can be huge, as SNCF has put a lot of data up. Some calls may even max out the api interface. **list line** by type is an example.
